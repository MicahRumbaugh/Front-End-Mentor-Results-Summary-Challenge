## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

Throughout this coding challenge, I learned how to apply custom styles and reinforce my knowledge and skills with CSS. It was complex at first but as I researched and applied what I was able to find, it became easier. I grew more confident using custom styles, using the grid system, and also with applying styles to specific elements. This was a good learning experience and helped me keep up with my development skills. 

### Continued development

I want to continue working on my knowledge and skills as a developer and challenge myself to learn new things every day. I want to challenge myself with new material and explore the many ways there are to achieve the same end result. I want to expand what I know about FE web development and also venture in to BE development as well.
